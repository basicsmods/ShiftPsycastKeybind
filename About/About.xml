	<description>Normally when you have a psycast with a keybind and you have multiple pawns with that psycast selected, the keybind goes to the first instance of that psycast and stays there even if that pawn can no longer use that psycast. This mod makes it so that as soon as the first pawn can no longer use that psycast, the binding shifts to the next pawn that can. As soon as the first pawn becomes able to cast it again, the binding moves back to theirs.</description>
